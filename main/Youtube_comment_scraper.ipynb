For instance, I consider myself a good reader, I can write, but my brain does not allow me to understand the content of texts (even written by myself), I have almost no short term memory or processing memory. This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply.

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

For instance, I consider myself a good reader, I can write, but my brain does not allow me to understand the content of texts (even written by myself), I have almost no short term memory or processing memory. This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply.

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",
