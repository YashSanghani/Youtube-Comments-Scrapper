For instance, I consider myself a good reader, I can write, but my brain does not allow me to understand the content of texts (even written by myself), I have almost no short term memory or processing memory. This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply.

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

For instance, I consider myself a good reader, I can write, but my brain does not allow me to understand the content of texts (even written by myself), I have almost no short term memory or processing memory. This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

This makes it very hard to learn anything via normal education. But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply. The focus should be on giving people  tools to be able to process the information properly before they start learning anything.\",\n",

It's hard at times but over the years I've been aiding him with almost everything.  I just wish he can refine his will power and  try to learn. It has been 11 years he had a stroke at 30 y old , please care for your body and brain. If you have kids please change your life for them. I've been taking care of him since 11.

But somehow by creating all kinds of tools for myself, I managed to get a degree on university level.\\nI could imagine that people who had a stroke could have the same problem. In that case 'work hard and then you learn something because the chemical changes in your brain' doesn't really apply.

It's hard at times but over the years I've been aiding him with almost everything.  I just wish he can refine his will power and  try to learn. It has been 11 years he had a stroke at 30 y old , please care for your body and brain. If you have kids please change your life for them. I've been taking care of him since 11. I'm now 22 and it has completely changed my aspect of life from other kids in their 20s. Live long and prosper guys‚ò∫Ô∏è\",\n",
